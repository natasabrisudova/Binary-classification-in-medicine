Early initiation of targeted treatment can prevent possible irreversible neurological complications of spondylodiscitis (SD) and/or spinal metastases (MET), but differentiation may be a diagnostic problem, especially in the early stages. Aim of this project is to build a neural network to distinguish SD and MET given the 31 radiomic features from lessions and discuss the efficiency of the model.
